        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>This website is dedicated to sharing some popular recipes from my Motherland, South Louisiana famous for
            jazz, Cajun food and Shaquille O'Neal.
            Most of the recipes are open to be tweaked and if you ever find yourself in Louisiana these dishes will
            likely be different depending on where you get
            them, simply due to different chefs having different takes on the recipes, but these are how my Dad taught
            me to make them.</p>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>There are many benefits to eating cajun, for example how cheap it is. Cajun food was born from poor
                French immigrants to Louisiana who needed as much carbs and protein for as cheap as possible, for as
                little money as possible.
                So they used whatever ingredients were abundant (lots of seafood and rice!) These recipes were adapted
                as people were able to afford better ingredients and now cajun food is known for its signature spicy
                flavor. <br>Another benefit of cajun food is its health benefits (you dont have to worry about your
                health
                if you die of heart failure at 45 due to the high butter content in your bloodstream.)</p>
